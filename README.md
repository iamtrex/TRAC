# TRACV 

TRACV is an Open Source Tower Defense Game created on the premises of learning basic Object Oriented Design Concepts. This began as a collaborative effort with some friends in order to teach them OOP and basic Java until school and work duties caused this to become my personal project. 

Currently still in development, but functional! (Try Level 5, other levels are mainly for testing purposes)

* The program is rooted in Object Oriented type heiarchy, where all game components (towers, enemies, projectiles) are built off of an ancestor GameComponet class.

* Structure based off a pre-designed UML Diagram. 

* It uses various Design Patterns such as Observer, Iterator, and Singleton.

* Uses custom Swing for a more modern look 


INSTRUCTIONS - 
* Clone code
* Add Jackson, JavaJSON, and JNativeHook Libraries
* Export Jar
* Run!
