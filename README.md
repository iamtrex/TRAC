# TRACV 

TRACV is an Open Source Tower Defense Game created on the premises of learning basic Object Oriented Design Concepts. This began as a collaborative effort with some friends in order to teach them OOP and basic Java until school and work duties caused this to become my personal project. 

Currently still in development, but functional! (Try Level 5, other levels are mainly for testing purposes)

Some Features 

* The program is built fundamentally from Object-Oriented design concepts. It uses inheritance, where all game components (towers, enemies, projectiles) are built off of an ancestor GameComponet class.

* Structure based off a pre-designed UML Diagram. 

* It uses various Design Patterns such as Observer, Iterator, and Singleton.

* Uses custom Swing for a more modern look 

* Implements algorithms such as A* to enable path-finding for Enemies

* Uses JSON Parsing for levels and settings. 



INSTRUCTIONS - 
* Clone code
* Add Jackson, JavaJSON, and JNativeHook Libraries
* Add res folder as resource root
