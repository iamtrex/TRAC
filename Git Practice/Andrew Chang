I don't know who you are. I don't know what you want. 
If you are looking for a ransom, I can tell you that I have no money.
But what I do have are a particular set of skills. 
Skills that I have a acquired over a very long career. 
Skills that make me a nightmare for people like you. 
If you let my daughter go now, that will be the end of it.
I will not find you, I will not pursue you. If you don't,
I will look for you. I will find you, and I will kill you.
